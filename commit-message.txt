M1: Workspace scaffolding (move scraper â†’ crates/websearch)

This commit restructures the repository into a Cargo workspace with the following changes:

- Created workspace structure with crates: core, websearch, analyzer, summarizer, and cli
- Moved the existing scraper code to crates/websearch
- Updated all imports and references to use the new crate structure
- Removed the embedding module which will be reimplemented in the analyzer crate
- Created empty stub crates for core, analyzer, and summarizer
- Created a new cli crate as the orchestrator entry point
- Added top-level configuration files (config.example.toml, .env.example, README.md)
- Added fixture directories for future testing

Build verification:
- cargo build succeeds at the workspace root
- cargo fmt formats the code correctly
- cargo clippy shows only minor warnings that don't affect functionality

Future steps will implement ONNX-based analyzer and the summarizer API.
